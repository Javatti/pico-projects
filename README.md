# Pico Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects and code examples for the Raspberry Pi Pico using MicroPython.

The Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller board that provides an affordable and versatile platform for embedded projects. It features the RP2040 microcontroller, which is designed by Raspberry Pi and includes a powerful dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor, along with various peripherals.

## Projects

1. SOS Morse Code (sos_morse.py)
This script demonstrates how to use a Raspberry Pi Pico to display the SOS Morse code using an LED connected to GPIO 25. The Morse code pattern will repeat every 3 seconds. This project is a great starting point for beginners who want to learn about basic GPIO control and timing in MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you'll need to set up your Raspberry Pi Pico with MicroPython. Follow the official documentation to learn how to install MicroPython on your Pico and start running the code.
